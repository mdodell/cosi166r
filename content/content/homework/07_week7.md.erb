## 1. Read these three articles about user interface design

We're not all going to be visual artists or graphic designers. But there are some really basic guidelines and rules of thumb that will get decent results for everyone. Even for people who think of themselves as "engineers" or even just interested in the "back end", a degree of basic proficiency in visual design is part of your toolkit. Please read these articles, and give them some thought. What did you learn? What did you disagree with? What would you add? Do you have another, better reference? Come up with one or two ways in which you can use these ideas to improve your product.

* [Clean Up Your Visual Mess](http://www.visualmess.com)
* [Principles of User Interface Design](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/)
* [Design Principles: Hierarchy](http://www.toptal.com/designers/visual/design-principles-hierarchy)

## 2. Work on a list of stories for your product  <%= pdfbadge %> <%= teambadge %>

* List of stories, prioritized, in Trello. Note that this should be your current best guess, but naturally you will be able to make changes as you go along. Remember that a story is a short description of a mini-feature. They often follow a format like "(persona) can to (action)", e.g. "Student can view a list of TAs.". Most of the time a story is one or a few sentences long. Think of it as what the programmer would what to know before trying implement the story. For example, "user can display to do list, and change the sort order either by priority or by date." You should google for product stories, or scrum stories, or writing a user story.

* Carefully worked out schema for your product. Include table names, column names, column datatypes, primary and foreign keys, and One/Many to One/Many relationship arrows.

<%= team_deliverable "pdf to the stories (printout from Trello), and pdf with your schema." %>


## 3. Complete work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_2 %>. <%= zipbadge %>

Submit your code as a zip file.

<%= deliverable "Rails app as a zip file." %>

Begin work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_3 %>.

## 4. **Read:** About security in Rails. We will be discussing this today

* Read [Rails Security Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html)
* Read about: [Brakeman Gem](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman)
* Think about how this applies to your product

## 5. Submit your Weekly Progress Updates <%= partbadge %> <%= teambadge %> <%= pdfbadge %>

Follow these instructions, <%= link_to_topic :weekly_progress_updates %> to prepare your status report.

<%= team_deliverable "Weekly Progress Update" %>

## 1. Paper Prototyping <%= pdfbadge %>

* Read this paper about [Paper Prototyping](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/paperprototyping/)
* Design a paper prototype for your team's product.  Remember, this is an individual assignment, so that we can compare each team member's vision of what the product might be. We will assess your work based on the care and thought you put into it, not on whether the UI itself is awesome.

<%= deliverable "Readable image of your paper prototype. If you just take a cell phone picture of a drawing in pencil (worst case) it will not be legible." %>
