:h2 1. Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-on-rails-6th-edition-tutorial/modeling_users) Chapter 6, "Modeling Users" :partbadge :pdfbadge

Another major step forward, and yes, this is a meaty chapter again. You will learn A LOT! How to create a User model (you kind of know that already) but more than that, we will learn about ActiveRecord validations and most importantly start thinking about authentication! *As the book suggests, don't use a canned authentication gem (yet) because they are often more work than work savers.*

As usual I really encourage and ask you to go through the code samples and actually type them in. You will see that it really helps your understanding and will assure your success in this course! Use your resources: the TAs, the class mailing list, stack overflow, google and push through to success! When you are done, go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:

* This one is tricky: how come there's no password field in the database, while there is a validation of a password attribute on the User model. Precisely how does the validation work? Let's have a careful answer here, because it's the only warmup question I am asking for!
* What is a regular expression and what is it used for?
* What is a database index and what is it used for?
* Are there one or two things you are still confused by? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading?

:deliverable Submit your answers as a pdf to latte

:h2 2. ActiveRecord Tricks :pdfbadge :partbadge

Study this video. You will learn a lot about ActiveRecord! [ActiveRecord Tricks](https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/activerecord-tricks).

Take notes while you are watching it (its very short.) I strongly recommend you download the code from his website and follow along. Below are my very rough notes on changes you need to make so it will work. Include in your notes three things that you learned that were super cool!

:deliverable Your notes about problems you hit getting the tricks to work and three supercool ideas you got and how you will use them
